# Challenge | IndexingMaster

Make a program to find the hidden word inside this array. 

For Python:
```python
[[{"firstwall":{"secondwall":[{"thirdwall":[{"anythingelse":[],"fourthwall":{"fifthwall":[{"something":"else"},{"anything":"else"},{"somethingelse":"","hiddenwords":"dlrow olleh"}]}}]}]}}]]
```

For Javascript:
```javascript
[{ firstwall: { secondwall: [{ thirdwall: [{ anythingelse: [], fourthwall: { fifthwall: [{ something: "else" },{ anything: "else"},{somethingelse: "",hiddenwords: "dlrow olleh"}]}}]}]}}]
```

# Note
The hidden words are also reversed so also reverse the hidden word to get the real word.
